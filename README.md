This id 3D house animation using   open cv and  c Language
A Computer Graphics project based on the concept of a “3D House Animation”. This 
project implements the view of a 3D House both inside and outside of the house. There 
are 5 components that are placed inside the house there are a fan, sofa, tv, a table, and
a teapot placed on the table. The outside of the house has trees and a system made for 
collecting rainwater (rainwater harvesting). The house is surrounded by a compound 
wall. The APIs that are used in implementing these components are glutSolidCube(), 
glutSolidTeapot(), glutSolidCone()… etc. An animation has been implemented which 
shows the rotation of the fan inside the house. Lighting has been implemented by the 
inbuilt OPENGL lighting functions. Menus have been provided to modify the various 
features such as changing the background, lighting, etc. This project implements both 
the orthographic and perspective views. Options have been provided in the menu to 
switch between the views
